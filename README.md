# JavaScript Challenges
JavaScript Challenges i have taken, from Wes Bos's "30 day vanilla JS coding challenge".

I've attempted each challenge myself, without looking at the instruction video, and reviewed wes's solutions only after i suceeded to compare our different solutions to each challenge. 

I've also Re-Designed most of the projects with my own Custom CSS code.

**Concepts i practiced in the challenges: **
- JavaScript Array Methods: `Reduce`, `Map`, `Filter`, `Find`, `Some`, `Every`
- Using JavaScript to dynamically work with CSS Variables
- Working with the `Date` Object (Creating a Clock & a Countdown Timer)
- Creating an Image Gallery using CSS Flexbox and JavaScript
- Creating a Sticky Nav-Bar with JavaScript and CSS
- Click and Drag items using JavaScript Mouse Events
- Creating a Custom Video Player & a Drum Kit using `HTMLMediaElement API `
- Creating a Drawing Board using the `Canvas API`
- Working with the browser's LocalStorage to Set and Delete stored Data
- Creating a Speech Synthesis Player with the `Web Speech API`
- Using the `Fetch API` to create a City's in USA (and city's population) search bar with a Type-Ahead suggestions Feature
- Creating a 'Whack A Mole'
- **BONUS:** I've also used the `Fetch API` to create a Random Cat Image Generator for my girlfriends' enjoyment. It also was fun to make!
